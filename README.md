## ANNOUNCEMENT: Now CapibaraZero is available for SBC that runs Linux(Raspberry Pi, OrangePi, ...). [Here](https://github.com/CapibaraZero/fw_linux) you can find more information.

CapibaraZero aim to be a cheap alternative to FlipperZeroâ„¢. It's based on ESP32 boards especially on ESP32-S3 but we want to port firmware to all ESP family boards.

This repo contains the main firmware that make capibaraZero works.

Most of attacks are separated in repository to isolate them from GUI to make project structure more readable.

## Build firmware

To build project just must have PlatformIO installed and a working version of GNU Bison and Flex

Before building project you must execute init_libs.sh to prepare PN532 libs

```bash
bash init_libs.sh   # Init NFC and Duktape libs
pio run
# To upload firmware
pio run -t upload
```

[You can use the precompiled firmware from releases](https://github.com/CapibaraZero/fw/releases)
